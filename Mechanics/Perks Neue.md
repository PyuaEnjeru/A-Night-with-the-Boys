## Old Design
 In the old zombie games perks are mostly immutable, they have one set effect and that's it (Except Quick Revive which differs between single and multiplayer)
 Limited to only having 4 at a time (Until Cold War) 
 Set costs for each perk and limited perks for each map
 There are clear winners with perks and that's reflected in their costs so you could pick and choose and always know what something would cost quickly from memory without calculation which helped keep the game simple
 Total Cost for the reperking can be around 10,000 points

 In Cold War its feels discouraging to get all the perks since you get the necessary perks for the cheap initial price (2500 + 500 * (PerkNumber - 1)) and with the vast amount of perks in Cold War it eventually means the last perk costs 7000 which makes it not worth it, especially with the total cost of perks ending up being 47,500! WOW!
 Re perking just the essential 5 perks costs 17,500 (Juggernaug, Quick Revive, Staminup, Deadshot and Speed)
 Even with the Perk Upgrading System of Cold War some of the perks are just Lack-Luster even at Level 5 or even debatably worse at max rank

 There's also the loose change Easter Egg which gives 100 points under each machine for fun competition amongst friends to get the small amount of points

## Our Design
 Perks should be good at the start and crazy good once upgraded
 There should be a few perk machines in each map
 This way they can be the focus of the map design so they're not disconnected and allow the player to be able to experiment with those specific perks while having what we consider "Core Perks" available at all maps
 There should be a Perk Machine and/or a Spot to get all perks available in the game
 Each perk should have a set cost
 Togglable Upgrades for extra challenge/Different setups for different situations
