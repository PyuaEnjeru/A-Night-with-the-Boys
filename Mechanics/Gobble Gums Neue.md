# Old Design
 Gobblegums are just a vehicle for micro transactions 
 It makes it kinda wack since they are pretty cool experimental powerups, even if some are broken
 The gambling mechanic was pretty fun but having limited not free powerups is kinda wack
 I love the fact that it is just a wide breadth of powerups and the pseudo randomness of getting them from a machine
 The randomness was based on a pool system, you bring 5 gobble gums and you get a random one each time, but it removes it from the pool so you will not pull it again until you "Drain the Pool" so to speak, you don't have to pick  it up and it will still be removed from the pool upon activation

# New Design
 Gobble gums are were experimental powerups are gonna live
 Where they don't quite fit somewhere or as a test for if it is actually worth having
 Or just like spawning something in like a power up
 Should have a way to have Full Random (All), Random (Selected), Set Order
